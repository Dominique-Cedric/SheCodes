Let's put what we just learned to practise.

These problems are tricky! Don't despair if you run into problems.

First, try to read the error message you get and see if you can decipher it.
Next, try googling the problem you're having to see if you can find a solution.
Feel free to try various solutions. It's ok to break stuff while you're trying to fix it.
Then, ask a mentor for help!
Q1: Write a program that takes two numbers from the user, and outputs their sum.
Example Input	Example Terminal Output
3
9	Enter a number: 3
Enter another number: 9
12.0
-3
9	Enter a number: -3
Enter another number: 9
6.0
3.0
-9	Enter a number: 3.0
Enter another number: -9
-6.0
Q2: Write a program that takes two numbers from the user, and outputs the equation representing the multiplication of the two numbers.
Example Input	Example Terminal Output
3
9	Enter a number: 3
Enter another number: 9
3.0 * 9.0 = 27.0
-3
9	Enter a number: -3
Enter another number: 9
-3.0 * 9.0 = -27.0
3.0
-9	Enter a number: 3.0
Enter another number: -9
3.0 * -9.0 = -27.0
Q3: Write a program that takes a distance in kilometers from the user, and output the distance in meters and centimeters.
Example Input	Example Terminal Output
10	How many kilometres? 10
10.0km = 10000m
10.0km = 1000000cm
5.4	How many kilometres? 5.4
5.4km = 5400m
5.4km = 540000cm
Q4: Write a program that takes the user's name and height (in centimeters), and outputs a summary sentence.
Example Input	Example Terminal Output
Ayda
149	What is your name? Ayda
How tall are you (cms)? 149
Ayda is 149cms tall.
Pin-Lee
178	What is your name? Pin-Lee
How tall are you (cms)? 178
Pin-Lee is 178cms tall.
Q5: Is the input function a statement or an expression?
Have a think, have a google, and ask your mentors to see if your intuition was correct!
